        <h2>Information Security Analyst at BMO</h2>
        <p>As an Information Security Analyst at BMO, I am part of the Vulnerability and Configuration Management Team, focusing on Cyber Threat Intelligence, Hardening Baselines, and Container Security. In my first year, I collaborated with various teams to enhance and refresh our security baselines. My daily responsibilities include analyzing CVEs, determining their risk levels, and providing severity recommendations. I work on baseline refresh projects, communicating with teams across cloud, on-premises, OS, middleware, and database environments. Additionally, I validate and maintain our organization's containerized applications.</p>
