The 1302 Project is a static web application designed to showcase the skills, experience, and projects of four students in the Digital Technologies program. This application provides a platform for students to display their work, share their interests, and demonstrate their web development skills. Initially, the project will feature profiles for the four founding students, with the potential to expand and include additional students who wish to participate in the future.

Target Audience and Their Needs

 Target Audience
- Potential employers in the tech industry
- Fellow students and peers in the web development course
- Personal connections and networking

 Needs
- A visually appealing and easy to navigate interface to showcase skills and projects
- A clear and concise display of individual profiles and interests
- Ability to view projects and details without requiring login or registration
- Responsive design for accessibility on various devices
- Accessibility features for users with disabilities

 Features and Functionalities
- Four individual profile pages with bio, skills, and interests
- Project showcase with images, descriptions, and links (if applicable)
- Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Accessibility features (e.g., alt text, semantic HTML)
- Simple and intuitive navigation and layout

 Technical Considerations
- Responsive design using CSS media queries and a mobile-first approach
- Accessibility features using ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, and high contrast colors
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript used for development (no backend or server-side coding)
- CSS Grid and Flexbox used for layout and design
- JavaScript used for interactive elements (e.g., accordion, tabs)

Project Workflow and Division of Work

1. Project Initialization: 
   - Set up the project repository on GitHub.
   - Create an initial project structure with directories for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets (images, etc.).

2. Design Phase:
   - Create wireframes and mockups for the application layout.
   - Define the colour scheme, typography, and overall design guidelines.

3. Development Phase:
   - Code the HTML structure for the main page and individual profile pages.
   - Style the pages using CSS, focusing on responsive design and accessibility.
   - Implement JavaScript for interactive elements.

4. Testing Phase:
   - Test the application across different devices and browsers to ensure responsiveness and accessibility.
   - Perform usability testing to gather feedback and make improvements.

5. Deployment:
   - Host the static website using GitHub Pages or another static site hosting service.
   - Ensure the site is live and accessible.

Division of Work

We will work on all aspects of the project together, collaborating on the following tasks:

1. Profile Pages:
   - We will collectively create and maintain the individual profile pages, including bios, skills, and interests.

2. Project Showcase:
   - We will work together to develop the project showcase section, ensuring that project details are correctly displayed and formatted.

3. Design and Layout:
   - We will jointly focus on the overall design and layout, including the responsive design aspects using CSS Grid and Flexbox.

4. Interactive Elements:
   - We will collaboratively implement and maintain JavaScript functionalities for interactive elements like accordions and tabs.


Version Control with Git and GitHub

- Branch Management:
  - Each student will work on their assigned section in separate branches named according to the feature they are working on (e.g., `maqeel/jsanimatoins`).
  
- Commit Guidelines:
  - Commit messages should be clear and descriptive, following the format: `type(scope): description` (e.g., `feat(profile): add bio and skills section`).

- Pull Requests and Code Review:
  - Before merging a branch into the main branch, a pull request must be created.
  - Each pull request will be reviewed by at least one other team member to ensure code quality and consistency.
  
- Merging and Conflict Resolution:
  - The team will work together to resolve any merge conflicts that arise.
  - Regular merges from the main branch into feature branches will be done to minimize conflicts.
